# Next.js Learn — Hands-on Practice Repository

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my hands-on practice and implementations while following the official **[Next.js Learn](https://nextjs.org/learn)** course.  
The main goal of this project is to build a solid and practical understanding of **Next.js** fundamentals, best practices, and modern full-stack patterns by implementing everything step by step.

This is a **learning-focused repository**, but structured using **professional standards**, clean commits, and clear documentation.
